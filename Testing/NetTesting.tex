\subsection{Net Class}
The Net class is used by the user to create a Neural Network and to select its properties, such as the loss being used, the number of features of the data, type of layers and activation function being used on each layer. The net class will also be used to add some functionality to the neural network such as making predictions using a batch of inputs or saving a specific model for later use. These are the results of the unit test on the Net class:
