\subsection{Mapping Class}
The mapping class relies heavily on the matrix class to function correctly. This is why the matrix class was tested before the Mapping class. The Mapping class can be used by the user to define their own activation or loss function or to use a predefined function for a specific layer in the network. These are the results of the unit test ran on the Mapping class:
