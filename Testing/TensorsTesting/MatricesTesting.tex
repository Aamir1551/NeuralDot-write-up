\subsection{Matrix Class}
The Matrix class is essential to the project as it is used by all my classes. Therefore, it is important that the matrix class works correctly, otherwise it would result in all the classes working incorrectly. Therefore, before doing unit tests on any other class, it is important that I first carry out a unit test on the matrix class. These are the results for the unit tests on the matrix class:
