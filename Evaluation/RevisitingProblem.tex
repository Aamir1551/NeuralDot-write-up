\section{Revisiting the problem}
In the future, if I were to revisit the problem, I would allow the user to view graphs of how the loss has changed over time. By adding graphs, it would make the library much more interactive. I would also include graphs showing the cost for different values of the weights and biases. Another area where I could improve upon is that I could also offer advanced optimisation methods for the convolutional layers, as training these layers using standard back-propagation algorithm is very slow. Finally, besides everything I have stated there isn't much that I would change as the project does meet the required objectives set and from the final interviews it also seems the project has met the users needs.

This problem that I am trying to solve however, can never be solved \textit{entirely}, mainly because it is an open problem. The needs of the users are constantly changing and machine learning is always advancing. It was only recently that dense nets became the number one go to for machine learning, therefore in the future the user may require different algorithms to suit their needs, however for the current climate of machine learning, this solution does meet the required objectives to counter the original problem; offering an easy to use machine learning library for beginners to use.
