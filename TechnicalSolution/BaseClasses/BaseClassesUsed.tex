    Base Class Implemented & Reason for Implementation \\ \cline{1-2}
    \textbf{Tensor} & The class \textbf{Tensor} is an \textit{abstract class} as it is never instantiated. The class Tensor is \textit{inherited} by the classes \textbf{Volume} and \textbf{Matrix} as both share functions and sub-routines in common. In addition to this, the class \textbf{Tensor} is an abstract class as the class \textbf{Layer} is a \textit{generic class} of type \textbf{Tensor}, allowing its derived classes to be of derived classes of type \textbf{Tensor}. Furthermore, functions in other classes such as \textbf{netData} also use both matrices and volumes implicitly, therefore, it is necessary to have a base class that both \textbf{Volume} and \textbf{Matrix} can inherit from.  \\ \cline{1-2}
    \textbf{Layer} & The class \textbf{Layer}, unlike \textbf{Optimiser} and \textbf{Tensor} is an \textit{interface} meaning no functions and subroutines are defined but instead gives a list of functions or sub-routines that must be defined in the classes that \textit{extend} from it. This interface is then extended by the \textbf{Dense}, \textbf{Conv}, \textbf{Reshape} and \textbf{Maxpool} classes. This saved time, as they had the same functions and therefore the interface \textbf{Layer} provided a template for creating these classes. Furthermore, this interface is a \textit{covariant generic interface}. The reason for this is that the class Net, stores a \textit{stack} of layers defined by the user. This is an example of \textit{composition} that was used in my project. Therefore, if the interface \textbf{Layer}, was not \textit{covariant} the \textit{derived} classes, such as \textbf{Dense}, \textbf{Conv}, \textbf{Reshape} and \textbf{Maxpool} would not be able to be pushed onto the stack as this would result in a run-time error. Therefore, to solve this issue, it was necessary to make the interface Layer a \textit{covariant generic interface} instead. Furthermore, having layer as a \textit{generic interface} makes intuitive sense as well, as the specific parameters for a particular function in a layer will depend upon the type of layer it is, as this will then dictate the type of the output from the function. Finally, one of my key extended objectives was enabling the user to create their own layers. Therefore, by having an interface called \textbf{layer}, the user can easily define their own layers by extending from the \textbf{Layer} interface. This allows easy creation of new layers, without having to change all the other classes just to integrate the new layer defined. \\ \cline{1-2}
    \textbf{Optimiser} & The \textbf{Optimiser} class is a \textit{MustInherit} class that is inherited by \textbf{GradientientDescentOptimiser} and \textbf{AdvancedOptimiser}. This class includes all the necessary functions a back-propagation algorithm may require. This makes it easy for users to create their own back-propagation algorithms, which was one of my extended objectives. Furthermore, the class also includes some key functions such as \textit{splitdata}, \textit{resetParameters}, \textit{calculateCost} and \textit{CalculateGradients}. These functions are used by the derived classes in their back-propagation procedure, by communicating with the base class. Furthermore, the class \textbf{Optimiser} has a \textit{MustOverride} function called \textit{run}, which is where the actual back-propagation procedure occurs and is used to train the net. By having this \textit{abstract class}, the user can easily create their own optimisation algorithms by defining the \textit{run} procedure of their optimisation class. \\ \cline{1-2}
    \textbf{Advanced Optimiser} & This base class was used as the optimisation methods, \textbf{Adam}, \textbf{Momentum} and \textbf{RMS} only work on dense nets. Therefore, it was necessary to have a base class that can avoid these optimisation methods being used to train the conv nets or other user-defined nets. Finally, if the user wanted to create an optimisation algorithm for dense nets, the user could \textit{inherit} from the \textbf{AdvancedOptimiser} class instead of inheriting from the \textbf{Optimiser} class. \\ \cline{1-2}
