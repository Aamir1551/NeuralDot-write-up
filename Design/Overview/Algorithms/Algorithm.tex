\subsection{Algorithms}
The main algorithms that will be used in the making of the NeuralDot library is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Neural Networks
    \item Optimisation
    \item Matrix Operations
\end{enumerate}

I will be discussing each of these algorithms in detail separately along with their respective pseudo-codes
