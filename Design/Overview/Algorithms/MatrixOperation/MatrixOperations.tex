\subsubsection{Matrix Operations}
Neural Networks would be impossible without the help of matrices to vectorise their implementation. Therefore, it is crucial for my project to use matrices for the computationally expensive tasks. Some key algorithms, I will be using are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Matrix Multiplication
    \item Convolution
    \item Matrix Transpose
    \item Basic Matrix Operations
\end{itemize}
