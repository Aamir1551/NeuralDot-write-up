\section{Overview}
For the aims to be met, it is important that we have a strong idea about what will be needed to be done in order to meet the objectives set. In this section, we will be discussing the core algorithms, core data-structures and also the user-interface of the library. The library will now be referred to as the NeuralDot library.
