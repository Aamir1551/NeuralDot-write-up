\section{User-Interface}
Due to my program being a library, I will not be having a proper user-interface. However I will be making my library as easy as possible to use as this is very clearly stated by my clients.
\\
The main method in which I will be interacting with my users are through exception handlers and comments I placed in my code. An important point to note about exception handlers however, is that there are 2 types. Ones that I purposefully placed in my code, and the other are because of the vb compiler finding error in my code or the users code. The second type of errors are something I will need to keep to a minimum, as the user will not know where the error is specifically. I will achieve this by thoroughly testing out my library and taking care of any overflow problems that could occur anywhere within my library. \\
On the other hand, exceptions written by myself, will provide the user with where they went wrong and details of how they can avoid it. These exceptions, will make the library more accessible for the user as they know exactly where they went wrong. \\
Finally, comments can also be used as a way to guide the users upon how certain algorithms work or what certain variables or parameters represent. This will allow the user to feel less restricted when using my library as they will know exactly what each function does at each stage.
